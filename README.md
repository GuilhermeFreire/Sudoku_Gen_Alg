# Sudoku Genetic Algorithm and Hill Climbing
This project was developed as part of the 2016.2 Artificial Intelligence course from UFRJ.

## About
The objective of this project is to find the solution to a sudoku puzzle using either a genetic or a hill climbing aproach.
The implementation of the Genetic algorithm uses the DEAP python library. Furthermore, the project was entirely made in python3, so it is possible that some bugs may occur when executing on an older version of python.
To run the scripts, make sure to have DEAP installed
```bash
pip install deap
```
